        <h2>Avenue Night Market - Phan Thong Details</h2>\
        <p>The Avenue Night Market, also known as Grand Market Avenue @ Map Pong, is strategically located next to the Amata Phan Thong Industrial Estate (part of Amata City Chonburi) in Chonburi Province, Thailand. This expansive industrial estate spans thousands of hectares and hosts over 700 companies, employing more than 200,000 workers, driving significant local economic activity. The market leverages this industrial hub's growth, with investments exceeding 50,000 baht per project and a robust 15% annual land sales growth, fueled by the Eastern Economic Corridor (EEC) development. Operating daily, the 500-stall market benefits from high foot traffic from industrial workers, residents, and visitors, ensuring consistent revenue from stall rentals and events.</p>\
        <p>Key Features:</p>\
        <ul>\
            <li>500 stalls categorized by type: product stalls at 100 baht, food stalls at 100 baht and 200 baht, and a dedicated food truck zone.</li>\
            <li>Ample parking lots (yellow areas) to accommodate high traffic.</li>\
            <li>Garden spaces (green) and restrooms (light green) for visitor comfort.</li>\
            <li>A central stage area for events, entertainment, and community gatherings, enhancing appeal.</li>\
            <li>Proximity to major infrastructure, supporting logistics and accessibility.</li>\
        </ul>\
        <p>Funding Needs: This project requires investment for development, operations, and expansion to meet the growing demand in the Phan Thong area, where land prices remain stable but show potential for appreciation due to EEC initiatives. Shares are available at 350,000 baht per 1%, with a minimum investment of 1% and a maximum of 49% ownership per person.</p>\
